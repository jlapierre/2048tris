# 2048tris

Todo:
- rotation still doesn't work
- if an L piece merges on its tail cell, the long side is left hanging when it should shift down one more
- weird bug where if i change directions right out of the buffer sometimes the cells will keep combining within the piece for an auto-win
- i should really write some tests for these instead of just hackin it
- add end screen instead of exiting the program
