# 2048tris

Todo:
- if a piece merges, blocks to the sides prevent cells from shifting down
- weird bug where if i change directions right out of the buffer sometimes the cells will keep combining within the piece for an auto-win
- i should really write some tests for these instead of just hackin it
- add end screen instead of exiting the program
- why do pieces leave ghost trails in the buffer?
